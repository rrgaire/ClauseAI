# ClauseAI Risk Rubric (MVP)

## Risk levels
- Low: Common/standard wording; balanced obligations; clear limits; no unusual asymmetry.
- Medium: Some asymmetry, ambiguity, or missing limits; could increase cost or legal exposure.
- High: Strong asymmetry or open-ended exposure; broad obligations; lacks caps/guardrails.

## What makes a clause risky (red flags)
- Uncapped liability / no limitation of liability
- Broad indemnity (covers "any and all", includes negligence, IP, third-party claims) with no cap
- Unilateral termination (one party can terminate easily; other cannot)
- Auto-renewal with strict notice window or long lock-in
- Assignment allowed without consent (especially to competitors)
- One-sided confidentiality or extremely long survival period
- Payment terms with punitive penalties / vague “reasonable” fees
- Governing law / venue unfavorable or one-sided
- Broad audit rights / intrusive obligations
- IP ownership ambiguous (especially work product / derivatives)
